# Fabric-Practice

📖 Project Overview
This project establishes a robust, enterprise-grade Banking Data Lakehouse designed to process millions of transactions and customer records. The solution follows the Medallion Architecture, moving from raw ingestion to business-ready aggregates.

Dual-Implementation Approach: The entire pipeline was successfully developed and tested twice—once using PySpark for programmatic flexibility and again using Declarative SQL for streamlined maintenance and readability.
